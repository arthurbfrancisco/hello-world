                    <h3>Benefits of traveling solo</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li>"No schedule to follow!"</li>
                       <li>The individuals you meet and encounter in life have the potential to become your 
                        lifelong friends.</li>
                       <li>Indulge in any food that you desire, as picky eaters are not welcome here! It's the 
                       inexpensive street food that often holds the most flavor and satisfaction.</li>
                      <li>This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that can easily become addictive, even after 
                        just one try.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <h3>What I learned during my time alone</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Avoid relying on others as your sole source of support and instead, use it to supplement your own efforts</li>
                    <li>You become your truest self, embodying who you are.</li>
                    <li>Experiencing the happiness of people in rural villages can bring a greater sense of purpose and significance to life, especially when they seem to be 
                      happier than the majority of people you know.</li>
                   <li>The best part of my trip was getting lost!</li>
                 </ul>
